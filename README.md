[![Rust](https://github.com/SpeedSX/university-manager-tui-rust/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/SpeedSX/university-manager-tui-rust/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

A Terminal-based User Interface (TUI) application for managing university data including students, teachers, and faculties. Built with Rust and the [ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui) library.

The whole code was generated by Github Copilot.

- **Teacher Management**: Add, edit, delete, and search for teachers
- **Faculty Management**: Add, edit, delete, and search for faculty departments
- **Tab-based Navigation**: Easily switch between students, teachers, and faculties
- **Search Functionality**: Find specific entries across all data types
- **Data Persistence**: All data is stored in JSON files

## Requirements

- Rust (tested on version 1.86.0)
- Cargo (comes with Rust)

- `faculties.json`: Faculty department records

## Implementation Details

This application is implemented in Rust using:
- `ratatui` for the terminal user interface
- `crossterm` for terminal manipulation and input handling
- `serde` and `serde_json` for data serialization and persistence
- `uuid` for generating unique identifiers
